            <p> The <a href="clinichistory.html">history of the RSPCA Cambridge animal clinic</a> dates back to the 1930s.
                Staff and hospital facilities for the clinic are provided by the <a href="http://www.vet.cam.ac.uk/">University
                    of Cambridge Veterinary School</a> who use it as a teaching centre where students can see real-life
                cases being treated by qualified vets. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1&v=ZF7HbUIgasY">View the
                    clinic in action.</a></p>

            <p> Without our cheap vet treatment for low income pet owners it is very likely that even more animals would be
                dumped or handed over to the local dog warden - and very probably put to sleep.</p>

        </div>

            <img class="thumbnail" src="img/vet.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="medium-8 columns">


            <p>There is no appointment system at the clinic and animals are seen on a first-come, first-served basis (except
                some very infectious cases who may have to be seen last). </p>
            <p>

                Registration normally begins at about 8:30 and no further cases will be admitted after 10:30, although
                everyone who has arrived by then will be seen. On busy days this will mean a long wait.</p>
            <p>

                <b>Please note</b>: If you are bringing a puppy or dog for their first vaccinations we advise that you come
                to the Wednesday session and not one of the open surgeries, to avoid bringing them into contact with other
                dogs who may already be carrying infection. If possible, leave the puppy in your car while you register and
                only bring them into the building when it is your turn to see the vet. Carry them so that they do not risk
                picking up infection from where other dogs have walked.</p>
            <p>


                Suspected cases of infection CANNOT be seen at the clinic on Wednesdays, to avoid risk to young animals who
                are there for their first vaccinations.</p>

        </div>

    <!--The FAQ section-->

    <div class="row">

        <div class="medium-6 columns">

            <h4>Is my pet eligible?</h4>
            <p>Our subsidised animal clinic in Cambridge is exclusively for “means- tested” benefits and pet owners who
                cannot afford private vet treatment and who live in our <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@52.204985,0.11604,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1yTDvo46R130kr5HwmJXjuwSXU_g?hl=en">catchment area.</a></p>
            <p>

                If you wish to use the clinic you MUST bring proof of benefits or paperwork (such as a bank statement which
                shows that you have a very low income) each time you visit.</p>
            <p>

                If you are unable to bring your pet yourself it's fine for a helper to bring them for you, but the helper
                must show proof that you are in receipt of benefit and needs to have a signed note from you confirming that
                they are bringing the animal on your behalf.
            </p>
            <!--<p>
                <a href="toclinic.html">Here is a flow chart which shows how we deal with requests for veterinary help.</a>
            </p>-->
        </div>
        <div class="medium-6 columns">
            <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
            <p>There is a basic <b>£15 charge per visit, plus the cost price of any medicines prescribed for your pet.</b></p>
            <p>

                The basic charge is payable to the RSPCA Cambridge and we use it to cover part of the cost of paying for
                vets to staff the clinic. Even though the university charges us less than a commercial rate, we do still
                need to pay for their services. <b>We now accept card payments as well as cash or cheque.</b>.
            </p>
            <p>Charges for medicines are paid directly to the University of Cambridge vet school. The vet school takes <b>cash, credit or
                debit card payments but cannot take cheque payments</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your pet needs an operation it will be charged at cost price, excluding the value of the operating
                surgeon's time. On average this means that you only pay half of what it costs the branch to provide
                treatment for your animal.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">

        <div class="medium-6 columns">
            <h4>Which animals can you treat?</h4>
            <p>The Cambridge clinic can treat most common domestic animals, but we do not have facilities for reptiles,
                poultry, exotic birds or farm animals.

            </p>
            <p>

                If your animal belongs to a group that we cannot treat at the clinic, it may be possible for us to provide
                some financial help to enable them to be seen at a private vet. If you live inside our <a href="map.html">branch
                area</a>, you can phone 07742 658 086 for advice about help. Otherwise phone the national control centre on
                0300 1234 999.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="medium-6 columns">
            <h4>What if my pet needs help out of hours?</h4>
            <p>Registered clinic patients only are eligible for out-of-hours emergency treatment. This is charged at a
                higher rate than normal sessions in order to prevent the service being abused for non-urgent cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your animal is registered with the clinic and has an infection which cannot wait until the following day,
                you should phone the number on your registration card for advice on what to do.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="medium-6 columns">
            <h4>Vaccinations</h4>
            <p>We can vaccinate dogs, cats and rabbits at the below prices. If possible, please try to bring animals needing
                vaccination only to the Wednesday session. This relieves pressure on the other open surgery days so that ill
                animals can be seen more quickly. Also, it reduces the risk that your puppy or kitten could pick up an
                infection from sick animals waiting in the surgery.

            </p>
            <p>

                Kitten and puppy vaccinations: £12 for the first vaccination and £12 for the booster 3 weeks later.</p>
            <p>
            <p>    Additional boosters should be given every year and are £17 for cats and dogs.</p>
            <p>   Rabbit vaccinations: £17. </p>
            <p> RHVD-2. Vaccination Annual Booster  (Rabbits) from 10 weeks of age: £12</p>
            <p>
                <b>Please note</b>: If your cat or dog has a litter and you plan to sell the puppies or kittens it is unfair
                to other owners to use our clinic for their vaccinations. You should charge the purchasers enough to cover
                the cost of the initial vaccinations at a private vet. Our staff have instructions to refuse to vaccinate
                litters of pedigree puppies where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the puppies will be sold for
                profit.

            </p>
            <p>

                <b>Important Warning</b>:
            </p>
            <p>
                Cambridge is a very high-risk area for myxomatosis, which is a distressing and almost always fatal disease
                of rabbits. The virus which causes the disease can be transmitted from wild rabbits to tame ones by biting
                insects such as mosquitoes without any need for direct contact. It is therefore extremely important that all
                pet rabbits are vaccinated to protect them against this killer disease.

            </p>
            <p>

                Cambridge is also a high-risk area for canine parvovirus which causes vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding from
                the intestines and is often fatal. Vaccination will protect your dog, but remember that vaccinations need to
                be maintained with yearly boosters to be fully effective.

            </p>
            <p>

                If your dog is not vaccinated and starts vomiting or has diarrhoea DO NOT let them mix with other dogs and
                phone your vet for advice. If you have more than one dog, keep the sick one away from the ones who are still
                healthy. Contact your vet by phone for advice before getting the healthy dogs vaccinated - they may be
                carrying the disease and it is important that they are not brought into contact with other dogs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="medium-6 columns">

            <h4>Neutering</h4>
            <p>Neutering will prevent your pet from having unwanted litters (remember that pet shops do not always sex
                animals correctly). It also has health benefits for most animals, such as greatly reducing the risk of tom
                cats contracting diseases from wandering and fighting other male cats. In the case of rabbits, neutering
                makes it possible for a male and female to live together and this is usually a much more harmonious pairing
                than two females or two males.
            </p>
            <p>
                To put your pet on the waiting list for neutering, you need to bring them to the Wednesday session, for a
                pre-operation health check. Payment should be made at this point and is:
            </p>
            <p>
                £20 for male cats, guinea pigs and ferrets
            </p>
            <p>
                £22 for male rabbits
            </p>
            <p>
                £40 for female cats
            </p>
            <p>
                £40 for female rabbits
            </p>
            <p>
                £48 for male dogs
            </p>
            <p>
                £65 for female dogs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="medium-6 columns">
            <p>All of the reception staff who handle the clerical work at the clinic are unpaid volunteers. Clinic
                reception involves dealing with sometimes very distressed people in a high-pressure environment and
                our receptionists are very special people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Space is limited, so it is only possible to have maximum of two new volunteers per session. New
                volunteers generally start by sitting in with an experienced team, then gradually do a greater
                variety of reception tasks until they feel confident.                 </p>
            <p>
                We are looking for an additional volunteer on reception for Wednesday mornings.  We are also keen to hear from anyone who would be willing to transport animals to the clinic from private vets where they have received initial first aid, and from the clinic to our kennels, or
                to <a href="foster.html">foster homes</a>. See our <a href="volunteer.html">RSPCA Cambridge
