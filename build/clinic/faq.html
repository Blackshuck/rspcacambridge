                    <p>
                      If you wish to use the clinic you MUST bring proof of
                      benefits or paperwork (such as a bank statement which
                      shows that you have a very low income) each time you

                      If you are unable to bring your pet yourself it's fine for
                      a helper to bring them for you, but the helper must show
                      proof that you are in receipt of benefit and needs to have
                      a signed note from you confirming that they are bringing
                      the animal on your behalf.

                      <strong
                        >&pound;15 charge per visit, plus the cost price of any

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The basic charge is payable to the RSPCA Cambridge and we
                      use it to cover part of the cost of paying for vets to
                      staff the clinic. Even though the university charges us
                      less than a commercial rate, we do still need to pay for
                      their services.
                      <strong
                        >We now accept card payments as well as cash or
                        cheque.</strong

                    <p>
                      Charges for medicines are paid directly to the University
                      of Cambridge vet school. The vet school takes
                      <strong
                        >cash, credit or debit card payments but cannot take
                        cheque payments</strong

                    <p>
                      If your pet needs an operation it will be charged at cost
                      price, excluding the value of the operating surgeon's
                      time. On average this means that you only pay half of what
                      it costs the branch to provide treatment for your animal.

                      The Cambridge clinic can treat most common domestic
                      animals, but we do not have facilities for reptiles,

                      If your animal belongs to a group that we cannot treat at
                      the clinic, it may be possible for us to provide some
                      financial help to enable them to be seen at a private vet.

                    We can vaccinate dogs, cats and rabbits at the below prices.
                    If possible, please try to bring animals needing vaccination
                    only to the Wednesday session. This relieves pressure on the
                    other open surgery days so that ill animals can be seen more
                    quickly. Also, it reduces the risk that your puppy or kitten
                    could pick up an infection from sick animals waiting in the
                    surgery.

                      Additional boosters should be given every year and are

                    <strong>Please note</strong>: If your cat or dog has a
                    litter and you plan to sell the puppies or kittens it is
                    unfair to other owners to use our clinic for their
                    vaccinations. You should charge the purchasers enough to
                    cover the cost of the initial vaccinations at a private vet.
                    Our staff have instructions to refuse to vaccinate litters
                    of pedigree puppies where they have reasonable grounds to
                    believe that the puppies will be sold for profit.

                    <p><strong>Important Warning</strong></p>
                    <p>
                      Cambridge is a very high-risk area for myxomatosis, which
                      is a distressing and almost always fatal disease of
                      rabbits. The virus which causes the disease can be
                      transmitted from wild rabbits to tame ones by biting
                      insects such as mosquitoes without any need for direct
                      contact. It is therefore extremely important that all pet
                      rabbits are vaccinated to protect them against this killer
                      disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Cambridge is also a high-risk area for canine parvovirus
                      which causes vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding from the
                      intestines and is often fatal. Vaccination will protect
                      your dog, but remember that vaccinations need to be
                      maintained with yearly boosters to be fully effective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If your dog is not vaccinated and starts vomiting or has
                      diarrhoea DO NOT let them mix with other dogs and phone
                      your vet for advice. If you have more than one dog, keep
                      the sick one away from the ones who are still healthy.
                      Contact your vet by phone for advice before getting the
                      healthy dogs vaccinated - they may be carrying the disease
                      and it is important that they are not brought into contact
                      with other dogs.

                  <p>
                    Neutering will prevent your pet from having unwanted litters
                    (remember that pet shops do not always sex animals
                    correctly). It also has health benefits for most animals,
                    such as greatly reducing the risk of tom cats contracting
                    diseases from wandering and fighting other male cats. In the
                    case of rabbits, neutering makes it possible for a male and
                    female to live together and this is usually a much more
                    harmonious pairing than two females or two males.

                  <p>
                    To put your pet on the waiting list for neutering, you need
                    to bring them to the Wednesday session, for a pre-operation
                    health check. Payment should be made at this point and is:

                  <h3>Helping out at the animal clinic</h3>
                  <p>
                    To see what life is like at the RSPCA Cambridge animal
                    clinic, take a look at our YouTube video:

                    <iframe
                      title="Video about volunteering at the RSPCA Cambridge Animal Clinic"

                  <p>
                    All of the reception staff who handle the clerical work at
                    the clinic are unpaid volunteers. Clinic reception involves
                    dealing with sometimes very distressed people in a
                    high-pressure environment and our receptionists are very
                    special people.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Space is limited, so it is only possible to have maximum of
                    two new volunteers per session. New volunteers generally
                    start by sitting in with an experienced team, then gradually
                    do a greater variety of reception tasks until they feel
                    confident.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We are looking for an additional volunteer on reception for
                    Wednesday mornings. We are also keen to hear from anyone who
                    would be willing to transport animals to the clinic from
                    private vets where they have received initial first aid, and
                    from the clinic to our kennels, or to
                    <a href="foster.html">foster homes</a>. See our
