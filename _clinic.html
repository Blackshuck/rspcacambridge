              history of the RSPCA Cambridge animal clinic
              <!--                    </a>-->
              dates back to the 1930s. Staff and hospital facilities for the
              clinic are provided by the
              <a href="http://www.vet.cam.ac.uk/"
                >University of Cambridge Veterinary School</a
              >
              who use it as a teaching centre where students can see real-life
              cases being treated by qualified vets.

            <p>
              Without our cheap vet treatment for low income pet owners it is
              very likely that even more animals would be dumped or handed over
              to the local dog warden - and very probably put to sleep.

            <h3 id="appointments">Appointments</h3>
            <p>
              There is no appointment system at the clinic and animals are seen
              on a first-come, first-served basis (except some very infectious
              cases who may have to be seen last).
            </p>
            <p>
              Registration normally begins at about 8:30 and no further cases
              will be admitted after 10:30, although everyone who has arrived by
              then will be seen. On busy days this will mean a long wait.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Please note</strong>: If you are bringing a puppy or dog
              for their first vaccinations we advise that you come to the
              Wednesday session and not one of the open surgeries, to avoid
              bringing them into contact with other dogs who may already be
              carrying infection. If possible, leave the puppy in your car while
              you register and only bring them into the building when it is your
              turn to see the vet. Carry them so that they do not risk picking
              up infection from where other dogs have walked.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suspected cases of infection CANNOT be seen at the clinic on
              Wednesdays, to avoid risk to young animals who are there for their
              first vaccinations.

            <h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
            <h4>Is my pet eligible?</h4>
            <p>
              Our subsidised animal clinic in Cambridge is exclusively for
              &quot;means-tested&quot; benefits and pet owners who cannot afford
              private vet treatment and who live in our
              <a
                href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@52.204985,0.11604,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!6m1!1s1yTDvo46R130kr5HwmJXjuwSXU_g?hl=en"
              >
                catchment area</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wish to use the clinic you MUST bring proof of benefits or
              paperwork (such as a bank statement which shows that you have a
              very low income) each time you visit.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are unable to bring your pet yourself it's fine for a
              helper to bring them for you, but the helper must show proof that
              you are in receipt of benefit and needs to have a signed note from
              you confirming that they are bringing the animal on your behalf.
            </p>
            <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
            <p>
              There is a basic
              <b
                >Â£15 charge per visit, plus the cost price of any medicines
                prescribed for your pet.</b
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              The basic charge is payable to the RSPCA Cambridge and we use it
              to cover part of the cost of paying for vets to staff the clinic.
              Even though the university charges us less than a commercial rate,
              we do still need to pay for their services.
              <b>We now accept card payments as well as cash or cheque.</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Charges for medicines are paid directly to the University of
              Cambridge vet school. The vet school takes
              <b
                >cash, credit or debit card payments but cannot take cheque
                payments</b
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your pet needs an operation it will be charged at cost price,
              excluding the value of the operating surgeon's time. On average
              this means that you only pay half of what it costs the branch to
              provide treatment for your animal.
            </p>
            <h4>Which animals can you treat?</h4>
            <p>
              The Cambridge clinic can treat most common domestic animals, but
              we do not have facilities for reptiles, poultry, exotic birds or
              farm animals.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your animal belongs to a group that we cannot treat at the
              clinic, it may be possible for us to provide some financial help
              to enable them to be seen at a private vet. If you live inside our
              <!--              <a href="map.html">-->
              branch area,
              <!--              </a>-->
              you can phone 07742 658 086 for advice about help. Otherwise phone
              the national control centre on 0300 1234 999.
            </p>
            <h4>What if my pet needs help out of hours?</h4>
            <p>
              Registered clinic patients only are eligible for out-of-hours
              emergency treatment. This is charged at a higher rate than normal
              sessions in order to prevent the service being abused for
              non-urgent cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your animal is registered with the clinic and has an infection
              which cannot wait until the following day, you should phone the
              number on your registration card for advice on what to do.
            </p>

            <h3 id="vaccinations">Vaccinations</h3>
            <p>
              We can vaccinate dogs, cats and rabbits at the below prices. If
              possible, please try to bring animals needing vaccination only to
              the Wednesday session. This relieves pressure on the other open
              surgery days so that ill animals can be seen more quickly. Also,
              it reduces the risk that your puppy or kitten could pick up an
              infection from sick animals waiting in the surgery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kitten and puppy vaccinations: Â£12 for the first vaccination and
              Â£12 for the booster 3 weeks later.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Additional boosters should be given every year and are Â£17 for
              cats and dogs.
            </p>
            <p>Rabbit vaccinations: Â£17.</p>
            <p>
              RHVD-2. Vaccination Annual Booster (Rabbits) from 10 weeks of age:
              Â£12
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Please note</strong>: If your cat or dog has a litter and
              you plan to sell the puppies or kittens it is unfair to other
              owners to use our clinic for their vaccinations. You should charge
              the purchasers enough to cover the cost of the initial
              vaccinations at a private vet. Our staff have instructions to
              refuse to vaccinate litters of pedigree puppies where they have
              reasonable grounds to believe that the puppies will be sold for
              profit.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Important Warning</strong>:</p>
            <p>
              Cambridge is a very high-risk area for myxomatosis, which is a
              distressing and almost always fatal disease of rabbits. The virus
              which causes the disease can be transmitted from wild rabbits to
              tame ones by biting insects such as mosquitoes without any need
              for direct contact. It is therefore extremely important that all
              pet rabbits are vaccinated to protect them against this killer
              disease.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cambridge is also a high-risk area for canine parvovirus which
              causes vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding from the intestines and is
              often fatal. Vaccination will protect your dog, but remember that
              vaccinations need to be maintained with yearly boosters to be
              fully effective.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your dog is not vaccinated and starts vomiting or has diarrhoea
              DO NOT let them mix with other dogs and phone your vet for advice.
              If you have more than one dog, keep the sick one away from the
              ones who are still healthy. Contact your vet by phone for advice
              before getting the healthy dogs vaccinated - they may be carrying
              the disease and it is important that they are not brought into
              contact with other dogs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="neutering">Neutering</h3>
            <p>
              Neutering will prevent your pet from having unwanted litters
              (remember that pet shops do not always sex animals correctly). It
              also has health benefits for most animals, such as greatly
              reducing the risk of tom cats contracting diseases from wandering
              and fighting other male cats. In the case of rabbits, neutering
              makes it possible for a male and female to live together and this
              is usually a much more harmonious pairing than two females or two
              males.
            </p>
            <p>
              To put your pet on the waiting list for neutering, you need to
              bring them to the Wednesday session, for a pre-operation health
              check. Payment should be made at this point and is:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Â£20 for male cats, guinea pigs and ferrets</li>
              <li>Â£22 for male rabbits</li>
              <li>Â£40 for female cats</li>
              <li>Â£40 for female rabbits</li>
              <li>Â£48 for male dogs</li>
              <li>Â£65 for female dogs.</li>

              All of the reception staff who handle the clerical work at the
              clinic are unpaid volunteers. Clinic reception involves dealing
              with sometimes very distressed people in a high-pressure
              environment and our receptionists are very special people.

              Space is limited, so it is only possible to have maximum of two
              new volunteers per session. New volunteers generally start by
              sitting in with an experienced team, then gradually do a greater
              variety of reception tasks until they feel confident.

              We are looking for an additional volunteer on reception for
              Wednesday mornings. We are also keen to hear from anyone who would
              be willing to transport animals to the clinic from private vets
              where they have received initial first aid, and from the clinic to
              our kennels, or to <a href="foster.html">foster homes</a>. See our
              <a href="volunteer.html">RSPCA Cambridge volunteers page</a> for
              more information.
