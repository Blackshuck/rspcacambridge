        <p>April 2020: Our shops are currently closed due to the Coronavirus outbreak.  Please email us to enquire about dropping donations off. </p>
        <!--    <p>Much of our fundraising is carried out through the activities of our three charity shops. We have a shop in Newmarket and two shops in Cambridge, one in Burleigh Street and the other in Mill Road that specialises in secondhand books. You can find these on the map in our About Us page.

                               Please support us by buying from our shops and donating items! If you are a UK tax payer, please take a few moments to complete a gift aid form when you donate at either of the Burleigh Street or Newmarket shops so we can reclaim tax when your donated item is sold.

                               If you are interested in volunteering in one of the shops, please sign up <a href="volunteer.html">here</a> or email or pop into one of the shops for a volunteering form, complete your details and bring it in to one of the shops. We would particularly like to hear from anyone who would like to reactivate our online sales via eBay and Abe Books.</p>-->

    <h4>Burleigh Street</h4>

    <div class= "medium-9 columns">
        <p>Address: 61 Burleigh Street, Cambridge, CB1 1DJ</p>

        <p>Telephone:  01223 312 802</p>

        <p>Opening Hours: Mon-Sun 10am-5pm</p>

        <p>We can make good use of any donations of clothing, shoes, bags, curtains, linens, bric-à-brac, toys etc. We also have a large section featuring second-hand books, vinyl records and CDs, as well as a variety of videos (DVD and VHS).

            We need your donations to keep our shop floor well-stocked. Please remember us when you are having a clear-out. If you would like to drop off donations by car, please phone the shop (01223 312 802) for directions to the unloading area behind us on Paradise street and to make sure someone is available to open the back door.</p>
        <p>We also need more volunteers to keep up with the task of processing and steam cleaning a constant flow of donated stock. If you might be interested, please drop in and ask to have a word with the manager on duty.</p>

        <p>Address: 188 Mill Road, Cambridge, CB1 3LP</p>

        <p>The RSPCA Cambridge secondhand and antiquarian bookshop is packed with lots of excellent books at reasonable prices. We need more volunteers with an interest in books and/or music (or just willing to carry books up and down the stairs!) to help out. If you could help please email us at info@rspca-cambridge.org.uk or phone the Burleigh Street shop on 01223 312 802.

            We are still collecting donations of clothing, linens, china, etc. etc. at the bookshop to sell at 61 Burleigh St. Only the best items will go out on sale at the shop, but even worn or damaged textiles can be sold for recycling and raise valuable funds to support our work.</p>

    <h4>Newmarket</h4>

    <div class= "medium-9 columns">

        <p>Address: 10a Market Street, Newmarket, Suffolk, CB8 8EE</p>

        <p>Telephone:  01638 662 053</p>

        <p>You can find Market Street at the entrance to the Guineas shopping arcade just off the High Street. Market Street is pedestrianised, but if you would like to drop off donations by car you can drive up to the back entrance of the shop via the access road which leads off Exeter Road. It may be advisable to phone the shop in advance to make sure they are aware that they need to let you in.

            We need more volunteers to work in the shop and to help with collecting donated goods to sell.

            If you might be interested in volunteering, please drop in for a chat.</p>
