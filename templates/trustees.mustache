              All RSPCA local branches are independent charities in their own

            <h3>Becoming a trustee</h3>
            <p>
              Trustees may be appointed in either of two ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>By annual ballot of the branch members at an AGM.</li>
              <li>
                Co-option during the year by vote of the current branch trustees
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Only adult RSPCA members of at least 3 months standing living in
              the branch area are eligible to stand for election at an AGM, but
              co-optees are not required to be members, so we often use this as
              a way for interested people to get some experience of what it
              involves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Branch trustees attend monthly committee meetings and many are
              also involved in the more day-to-day running of the branch. In
              fact, most RSPCA branches have few or no paid staff and branch
              trustees do a large amount of practical work in addition to
              decision-making.
            </p>

            <h3>About the branch</h3>
            <p>
              The RSPCA Cambridge branch covers an area stretching from
              Littleport in the north to just south of Royston and from
              Gamlingay to Newmarket in a west-east direction.
            </p>

            <p>
              We run a low-cost animal clinic in Cambridge which treats around
              4,000 animals each year, and each year we rehome around 200
              animals, mostly cases brought in by RSPCA inspectors or injured
              strays.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have an annual turnover of just under Â£250,000 and are
              constantly striving to improve in order to provide more services,
              as we feel we are only scratching the surface of the level of
              need. The branch has three charity shops, which do employ paid
              managers, and generate the largest part of our regular income
              stream. For more information on branch activities see our
