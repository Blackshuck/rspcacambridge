              <a href="{{assetPrefix}}10point.html">10-point plan</a> to ensure
              that we keep RSPCA services going in the Cambridge area. However,
              to achieve this we always need more volunteers, so we will be very
              grateful for any help that you can offer us. Volunteering for the
              RSPCA gives an enormous sense of satisfaction that you are doing
              something really worthwhile to help animals in the local area.

                  Every RSPCA branch needs a minimum of 7 trustees and a maximum
                  of 14. We are currently running very close to the lower end of
                  the scale, so would love to be in a position where we do not
                  need to worry about meeting the minimum requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The basic duty of RSPCA trustees is to attend monthly
                  committee meetings to make decisions about the management of
                  the branch. However many trustees do get involved in more
                  hands-on ways, for example with fundraising, rehoming animals
                  and running branch activities.
                </p>

                  Hosting events is an effective way of raising both money and
                  awareness of what the RSPCA Cambridge does. But to host them
                  we of course need enough people to help out. This is an area
                  where we are currently struggling, so any time you could give
                  to help with an event would be much appreciated. See our
                  <a href="{{assetPrefix}}news.html">News</a> page for
                  information on upcoming events. Alternatively, if you have a
                  good idea about a fundraising event, please contact our
                  Fundraising Coordinator.

                  These animals are usually strays who have been found injured
                  and taken into the care of the RSPCA. We keep a list of
                  volunteers offering help with transport and phone round until
                  we find someone who's free to do a job when we have an animal
                  needing to be moved, so you don't necessarily need to be
                  available all day.

                  Transporting animals to the clinic can involve quite a lot of
                  waiting around as animals will generally be assessed by the
                  clinic and the volunteer driver will then take them up to the
                  veterinary hospital for inpatient treatment.

                  Please note: If you want to work with animals you need to be
                  aware that this is a highly competitive and often very poorly
                  paid field. Even vets, who are probably the highest potential
                  earners, can expect to start their working life with a
                  substantial student debt and to work very long, hard hours.
                  Jobs working with animal charities are scarce because nearly
                  all charities struggle to raise enough funds to employ many
                  helpers.

                  If you are thinking about selecting a college course, ask
                  questions about the kinds of jobs it will qualify you to do.
                  You need to be aware that basic animal care courses won't
                  necessarily lead to a qualification which will get you into
                  employment and you may be better off with something more
                  specific, such as veterinary nursing, farriery or pet grooming
                  which will be of direct use to a potential employer.

                  Apart from the above there is always a list of other
                  activities that you would be able to get involved with. Some
                  examples include a roving photographer to take pictures at
                  events, addressing Gift Aid envelopes for donations, helping
                  out with our website and newsletter, but that is by no means
                  all.
