              Every local RSPCA branch is a separate charity, so
              <!--              contrary to what many people think, -->
              the RSPCA Cambridge does not receive automatic funding and local
              branch animal welfare services entirely depend on what we can
              raise. We have a
              <a href="{{assetPrefix}}10point.html">10-point plan</a> to ensure
              that we keep full services running and to do this we need to raise
              &pound;100,000 per year.

            <h4>Sponsor a dog or cat in kennels</h4>
            <p>
              One of our biggest expenses is the cost of boarding animals until
              they can be rehomed. At present we sadly have to turn away many
              people who can no longer manage to keep their pets because we
              simply do not have the funds to take them in. It is very likely
              that many of the owners we cannot help but decide to have their
              animals put to sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is something we really want to avoid and you can help by
              sponsoring a kennel space. A

              of just &pound;6 will cover the costs of one unit for one day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sponsoring kennel spaces means that we can admit more animals and
              provide more veterinary care.

            <h3>Legacies</h3>
            <p>
              Leaving us a legacy in your will is another way that you can help.
              To ensure that this legacy is spent locally you need to specify
              that it should go to the Cambridge &amp; District RSPCA Branch,
              registered
              <a
                href="https://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=205098&SubsidiaryNumber=0"
                >charity number 205098</a
              >. This charity number is unique, so is the best way of
              identifying us as a beneficiary.
            </p>
            <p>
              Legacies to RSPCA branches are normally handled via the
              <a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/getinvolved/donate/legacy"
                >Legacy department</a
              >
              of the national RSPCA, who have the expertise to deal with issues
              involved in handling the administration of an estate. If you
              direct your executors to forward your legacy to them at RSPCA,
              Legacy Team, Wilberforce Way, Southwater, Horsham, West Sussex
              RH13 9RS, they will arrange for the funds to be transferred to the
              Cambridge &amp; District branch.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wish the RSPCA to act as your executor and administer your
              estate, this can also be arranged. Please look through the
              national website details about
              <a
