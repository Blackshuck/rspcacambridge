          The RSPCA Cambridge takes in a wide variety of homeless animals in
          need of a new start. Are you looking for a new pet to share your
          life with? Take a look at
          <a target="_blank" href="https://rspca-cambridge-rehome.blogspot.co.uk/">our rehoming gallery</a>
          to see the rescue animals currently in our care that need a good home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cats and dogs are primarily adopted via the private boarding kennels
          where we keep them, while smaller animals such as ferrets, guinea pigs,
          fancy rats, mice, hamsters, gerbils etc are kept in individual fosterersâ€™ homes.
        </p>

        <p>
          This does mean that the small animals can be scattered over a wide area,
          so please be aware that making arrangements to view them can be slightly
          more complicated. You should also be aware that the smaller animals,
          although making lovely pets, don't have a very long lifespan.
        </p>
