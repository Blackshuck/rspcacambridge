              April 2020: Our shops are currently closed due to the Coronavirus
              outbreak. Please email us to enquire about dropping donations off.

              Much of our fundraising is carried out through the activities of
              our three charity shops. Please support us by buying from our
              shops and donating items!
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are a UK tax payer, please take a few moments to complete a
              <strong>Gift Aid</strong> form when you donate at either of the
              Burleigh Street or Newmarket shops so we can reclaim tax when your
              donated item is sold.

              The RSPCA Cambridge secondhand and antiquarian bookshop is packed
              with lots of excellent books at reasonable prices. We need more
              volunteers with an interest in books and/or music (or just willing
              to carry books up and down the stairs!) to help out.

              You can find Market Street at the entrance to the Guineas shopping
              arcade just off the High Street. Market Street is pedestrianised,
              but if you would like to drop off donations by car you can drive
              up to the back entrance of the shop via the access road which
              leads off Exeter Road.
            </p>

              It may be advisable to phone the shop in advance to make sure they
              are aware that they need to let you in.
