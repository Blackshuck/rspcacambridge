              As an independent charity, we are always looking for ways to raise
              more funds to ensure that we can continue to provide vital animal
              welfare services to the Cambridge region. So we have come up with
              this 10-point plan to show just how much of a difference you would
              be making if you could help us out with even just one of the
              points.
