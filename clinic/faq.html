    <h4 id="eligibility" data-magellan-target="eligibility">
        Is my pet eligible?
    </h4>
    <p>
        Our subsidised animal clinic in Cambridge is exclusively for
        &quot;means-tested&quot; benefits and pet owners who cannot
        afford private vet treatment and who live in our
        <a

            catchment area</a
        >.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to use the clinic you MUST bring proof of benefits
        or paperwork (such as a bank statement which shows that you
        have a very low income) each time you visit.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are unable to bring your pet yourself it's fine for a
        helper to bring them for you, but the helper must show proof
        that you are in receipt of benefit and needs to have a signed
        note from you confirming that they are bringing the animal on
        your behalf.
    </p>
    <h4 id="cost" data-magellan-target="cost">
        How much does it cost?
    </h4>
    <p>
        There is a basic
        <strong
        >&pound;15 charge per visit, plus the cost price of any
            medicines prescribed for your pet</strong
        >.
    </p>
    <p>
        The basic charge is payable to the RSPCA Cambridge and we use
        it to cover part of the cost of paying for vets to staff the
        clinic. Even though the university charges us less than a
        commercial rate, we do still need to pay for their services.
        <strong
        >We now accept card payments as well as cash or
            cheque.</strong
        >
    </p>
    <p>
        Charges for medicines are paid directly to the University of
        Cambridge vet school. The vet school takes
        <strong
        >cash, credit or debit card payments but cannot take cheque
            payments</strong
        >.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your pet needs an operation it will be charged at cost
        price, excluding the value of the operating surgeon's time. On
        average this means that you only pay half of what it costs the
        branch to provide treatment for your animal.
    </p>
    <h4 id="which-animals" data-magellan-target="which-animals">
        Which animals can you treat?
    </h4>
    <p>
        The Cambridge clinic can treat most common domestic animals,
        but we do not have facilities for reptiles, poultry, exotic
        birds or farm animals.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your animal belongs to a group that we cannot treat at the
        clinic, it may be possible for us to provide some financial
        help to enable them to be seen at a private vet. If you live
        inside our
        <!--              <a href="map.html">-->
        branch area,
        <!--              </a>-->
        you can phone
        <a href="tel:+447742658086">07742 658 086</a> for advice about
        help. Otherwise phone the national control centre on
        <a href="tel:+443001234999">0300 1234 999</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="out-of-hours" data-magellan-target="out-of-hours">
        What if my pet needs help out of hours?
    </h4>
    <p>
        Registered clinic patients only are eligible for out-of-hours
        emergency treatment. This is charged at a higher rate than
        normal sessions in order to prevent the service being abused
        for non-urgent cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your animal is registered with the clinic and has an
        infection which cannot wait until the following day, you
        should phone the number on your registration card for advice
        on what to do.

<section id="vaccinations" data-magellan-target="vaccinations">
    <h3>Vaccinations</h3>
    <p>
        We can vaccinate dogs, cats and rabbits at the below prices.
        If possible, please try to bring animals needing vaccination
        only to the Wednesday session. This relieves pressure on the
        other open surgery days so that ill animals can be seen more
        quickly. Also, it reduces the risk that your puppy or kitten
        could pick up an infection from sick animals waiting in the
        surgery.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Kitten and puppy vaccinations: &pound;12 for the first
            vaccination and &pound;12 for the booster 3 weeks later.
        </li>
        <li>
            Additional boosters should be given every year and are
            &pound;17 for cats and dogs.
        </li>
        <li>Rabbit vaccinations: &pound;17.</li>
        <li>
            RHVD-2. Vaccination Annual Booster (Rabbits) from 10 weeks
            of age: &pound;12
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Please note</strong>: If your cat or dog has a litter
        and you plan to sell the puppies or kittens it is unfair to
        other owners to use our clinic for their vaccinations. You
        should charge the purchasers enough to cover the cost of the
        initial vaccinations at a private vet. Our staff have
        instructions to refuse to vaccinate litters of pedigree
        puppies where they have reasonable grounds to believe that the
        puppies will be sold for profit.

        <p><strong>Important Warning</strong></p>
        <p>
            Cambridge is a very high-risk area for myxomatosis, which is
            a distressing and almost always fatal disease of rabbits.
            The virus which causes the disease can be transmitted from
            wild rabbits to tame ones by biting insects such as
            mosquitoes without any need for direct contact. It is
            therefore extremely important that all pet rabbits are
            vaccinated to protect them against this killer disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cambridge is also a high-risk area for canine parvovirus
            which causes vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding from the
            intestines and is often fatal. Vaccination will protect your
            dog, but remember that vaccinations need to be maintained
            with yearly boosters to be fully effective.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your dog is not vaccinated and starts vomiting or has
            diarrhoea DO NOT let them mix with other dogs and phone your
            vet for advice. If you have more than one dog, keep the sick
            one away from the ones who are still healthy. Contact your
            vet by phone for advice before getting the healthy dogs
            vaccinated - they may be carrying the disease and it is
            important that they are not brought into contact with other
            dogs.

<section id="neutering" data-magellan-target="neutering">
    <h3>Neutering</h3>
    <p>
        Neutering will prevent your pet from having unwanted litters
        (remember that pet shops do not always sex animals correctly).
        It also has health benefits for most animals, such as greatly
        reducing the risk of tom cats contracting diseases from
        wandering and fighting other male cats. In the case of
        rabbits, neutering makes it possible for a male and female to
        live together and this is usually a much more harmonious
        pairing than two females or two males.
    </p>
    <p>
        To put your pet on the waiting list for neutering, you need to
        bring them to the Wednesday session, for a pre-operation
        health check. Payment should be made at this point and is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&pound;20 for male cats, guinea pigs and ferrets</li>
        <li>&pound;22 for male rabbits</li>
        <li>&pound;40 for female cats</li>
        <li>&pound;40 for female rabbits</li>
        <li>&pound;48 for male dogs</li>
        <li>&pound;65 for female dogs.</li>

    <h3>Helping out at the animal clinic</h3>

        To see what life is like at the RSPCA Cambridge animal clinic,
        take a look at our YouTube video:

    </div>
    <p>
        All of the reception staff who handle the clerical work at the
        clinic are unpaid volunteers. Clinic reception involves
        dealing with sometimes very distressed people in a
        high-pressure environment and our receptionists are very
        special people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Space is limited, so it is only possible to have maximum of
        two new volunteers per session. New volunteers generally start
        by sitting in with an experienced team, then gradually do a
        greater variety of reception tasks until they feel confident.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are looking for an additional volunteer on reception for
        Wednesday mornings. We are also keen to hear from anyone who
        would be willing to transport animals to the clinic from
        private vets where they have received initial first aid, and
        from the clinic to our kennels, or to
        <a href="foster.html">foster homes</a>. See our
        <a href="volunteer.html">RSPCA Cambridge volunteers page</a>
        for more information.
