        The
        <!--                    <a href="clinichistory.html">-->
        history of the RSPCA Cambridge animal clinic
        <!--                    </a>-->
        dates back to the 1930s. Staff and hospital facilities for the
        clinic are provided by the
        <a href="http://www.vet.cam.ac.uk/"
        >University of Cambridge Veterinary School</a
        >
        who use it as a teaching centre where students can see
        real-life cases being treated by qualified vets.

        Without our cheap vet treatment for low income pet owners it
        is very likely that even more animals would be dumped or
        handed over to the local dog warden - and very probably put to
        sleep.
