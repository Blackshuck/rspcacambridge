    <h3>Appointments</h3>
    <p>
        There is no appointment system at the clinic and animals are
        seen on a first-come, first-served basis (except some very
        infectious cases who may have to be seen last).
    </p>
    <p>
        Registration normally begins at about 8:30 and no further
        cases will be admitted after 10:30, although everyone who has
        arrived by then will be seen. On busy days this will mean a
        long wait.
    </p>
    <div class="callout warning">
        <p>
            <strong>Please note</strong>: If you are bringing a puppy or
            dog for their first vaccinations we advise that you come to
            the Wednesday session and not one of the open surgeries, to
            avoid bringing them into contact with other dogs who may
            already be carrying infection. If possible, leave the puppy
            in your car while you register and only bring them into the
            building when it is your turn to see the vet. Carry them so
            that they do not risk picking up infection from where other
            dogs have walked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suspected cases of infection CANNOT be seen at the clinic on
            Wednesdays, to avoid risk to young animals who are there for
            their first vaccinations.
        </p>
